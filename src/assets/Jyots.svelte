                    Jyotsna is a third-year Computer Science student from <span style="background: linear-gradient(to right, #FF9933, #FFFFFF, #138808); -webkit-background-clip: text; -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;">India</span> at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, with a strong interest in building things that are technically smart and genuinely meaningful. Over the past few years, she has worked across all spheres of software — from UI design to development and quality assurance. Now, she brings that experience and her knowledge of AI/ML systems into building Vexos.

                <p class="text-md leading-relaxed pb-6 text-right">
                    Outside of academic and internship work, Jyotsna spends a majority of her time on projects that reflect her personal interests — whether it’s learning Arabic, collecting vegetarian recipes, diving into the history of coffee, or building platforms to fix messy group coordination. She’s happiest when she’s creating something useful, especially when it blends her technical skills with curiosity.
